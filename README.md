# Simple-Search-Engine
A simple search engine that can search through given data. 


A school assignment where I was required to develop a simple search engine that can search through given data files that represent webpages on the internet. The program, when given a query, determines which webpages are most relevant and returns them in a browser like structure; first result being the most relevant data file.

Written in python and makes use of the following:
- AVL Trees
- Max Heaps
- Priority Queues

HOW TO USE: Type the query you wish to search for in the "queries (1).txt" file. Can support the search of several queries; do this by putting a new query on a new line.
